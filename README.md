# BioinformaticsSoftwares

Just a few tools/softwares that have come handy for my research. Often times I find that the hardest part is often finding the right software to use. 

## File manipulation tools

### Bedtools (For manipulating bed files)

Arguably one of the most used bioinformatics software. Super easy to use and install https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

### Samtools (For manipulating SAM/BAM files)

Converting SAM to BAM etc. Really useful for high-throughput sequencing data http://www.htslib.org/

### Seqkit (For manipulating fasta/q files)

Really useful command line tool in dealing with fasta/fastq files. https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/

### Biopython

Python library to deal with fasta files etc. Super useful if you code in python! https://biopython.org/

### Bioconductor

Lots of great bioinformatics based packages in R. I think my fav use of this is direct access to databases like Ensembl, mammalian genomes (hg19) etc.

## Read mapping softwares

Bowtie2, BWA for DNA read mapping.
